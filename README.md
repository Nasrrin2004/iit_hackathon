# README for Temperature Prediction with Stacking Regressor

This project demonstrates a comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed to predict average temperatures based on historical weather data using a variety of advanced regression techniques. The pipeline begins with data preprocessing, where missing values are imputed using median imputation, and relevant features are engineered, including date-related attributes like year, month, and day, as well as polynomial interactions between temperature-related variables. After scaling the features, feature selection is performed using **GradientBoostingRegressor**, which helps to reduce dimensionality and retain the most important variables for model training. The core of the pipeline is a **Stacking Regressor**, an ensemble approach that combines the strengths of several base models—such as **MLPRegressor**, **XGBRegressor**, **GradientBoostingRegressor**, **RandomForestRegressor**, and **ElasticNet**—to make more robust predictions. The final estimator in the ensemble is a **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**, chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships in the data. The model is trained on the processed dataset and evaluated on validation data using key metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **R²**, ensuring a high degree of accuracy in the predictions. The trained model is then applied to unseen test data, with the results saved as a CSV file in the required format for submission. This solution is well-suited for tasks involving time-series forecasting, where capturing trends, interactions, and seasonality is critical to achieving low error rates and high predictive power.
